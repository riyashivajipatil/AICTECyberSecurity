# AICTECyberSecurity
Secret messages are encrypted and embedded into images using a user-supplied key. Decryption necessitates the image and matching key. A security feature locks decryption for 60 seconds after two incorrect key entries, offering a retry option afterward.


This project uses "OpenCV" and "NumPy" to implement image steganography, hiding encrypted messages within images. It secures data with XOR encryption and a retry-limited decryption process.And "time" for handling time-based security locks, "os" for system-level operations like opening the encrypted image.
